### üß† Machine Learning Approach Used

The project employs **deep learning**, specifically using the **Keras** API with a **TensorFlow** backend, to train a neural network that predicts optimal chess moves based on historical game data.

### üß± Model Architecture

The neural network is structured as a **feedforward deep neural network** (also known as a multilayer perceptron). Here's an overview of its architecture:

* **Input Layer**: Processes the encoded representation of the current board state.

* **Hidden Layers**: Multiple dense (fully connected) layers with activation functions (e.g., ReLU) to capture complex patterns in the data.

* **Output Layer**: Uses a softmax activation function to output a probability distribution over all possible legal moves, effectively predicting the most likely next move.

The model is trained using the **categorical cross-entropy** loss function, appropriate for multi-class classification problems, and optimized with the **Adam** optimizer.

### üóÑÔ∏è Data Processing and Training

The training process involves the following steps:

1. **Data Extraction**: Chess games are extracted from PGN (Portable Game Notation) files using the `extract_data.py` script.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The extracted games are converted into a format suitable for training, where each board state is paired with the move made in that state.

3. **Encoding**: Board states and moves are encoded into numerical representations. The `move_encoder.pkl` file is likely used to map moves to numerical labels.

4. **Model Training**: The processed data is fed into the neural network for training. The model learns to predict the next move given a particular board state.

5. **Model Saving**: After training, the model is saved as `my_chess_bot.h5` for later use in prediction and gameplay.

### üß† Summary

In summary, the project utilizes a **supervised deep learning** approach, training a feedforward neural network to predict chess moves based on historical game data. The use of Keras and TensorFlow facilitates the construction and training of the model, while additional scripts handle data extraction, preprocessing, and encoding.
